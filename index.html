            <p>This is Yi's hideout, where Yi resides. Although, Yi is orginally from Ontario, he thinks his current
                hideout
                is
                <em>amazing.</em> Yi is a chill guy who enjoys weightlifting, volleyball, and listening to
                music. He has a variety of favorite foods, but he does not like cheese.<strong> Do not give him cheese
                    at
                    all!</strong>
